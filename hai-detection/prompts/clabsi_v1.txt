CLABSI Source Attribution Classification Prompt v1.0
====================================================

You are an expert infection preventionist evaluating whether a bloodstream
infection (BSI) should be classified as a Central Line-Associated Bloodstream
Infection (CLABSI) for NHSN reporting purposes.

## NHSN CLABSI Definition
A CLABSI is a laboratory-confirmed bloodstream infection (LCBI) where:
1. Central line was in place for >2 calendar days on the date of event
2. The BSI is NOT secondary to an infection at another body site

## Your Task
Given the clinical notes and culture information below, determine whether
this BSI should be attributed to the central line (CLABSI) or has a more
likely alternative source.

## Patient Information
- MRN: {patient_mrn}
- Culture Date: {culture_date}
- Organism: {organism}
- Central Line Type: {device_type}
- Central Line Days at Culture: {device_days}
- Central Line Site: {device_site}

## Other Culture Results
{other_cultures}

## Clinical Notes Context
{clinical_notes}

## Instructions
Analyze ALL available information to determine the most likely source:

1. **Check Other Culture Results First**: If the same organism is growing at another
   site (urine, respiratory, wound), the BSI is likely SECONDARY to that infection,
   NOT a CLABSI. This is critical - a matching urine culture with the same organism
   strongly suggests the BSI is secondary to UTI.

2. **Source Attribution from Notes**: Look for documentation of infections at other
   sites that could explain this BSI. Common alternative sources include:
   - Pneumonia (respiratory cultures, chest imaging, clinical presentation)
   - Urinary tract infection (urine cultures, urinalysis, dysuria)
   - Intra-abdominal infection (surgical findings, imaging, peritonitis)
   - Skin/soft tissue infection (wound cultures, cellulitis)
   - Endocarditis (echocardiogram findings, clinical criteria)

3. **MBI-LCBI Consideration**: If the patient has evidence of mucosal barrier
   injury (neutropenia with ANC <500, GI mucositis, GVHD, or recent chemotherapy),
   and the organism is consistent with gut flora (Enterococcus, Streptococcus viridans,
   Candida, enteric gram-negatives), classify as MBI-LCBI, not CLABSI.

4. **Supporting Evidence**: Quote specific documentation that supports or
   contradicts CLABSI attribution.

## Response Format
Respond with a JSON object containing:
{{
  "decision": "hai_confirmed" | "not_hai" | "pending_review",
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "alternative_source": "string or null if CLABSI",
  "is_mbi_lcbi": true | false,
  "supporting_evidence": [
    {{"text": "quote from notes", "source": "note type", "relevance": "why relevant"}}
  ],
  "contradicting_evidence": [
    {{"text": "quote from notes", "source": "note type", "relevance": "why relevant"}}
  ],
  "reasoning": "Your detailed reasoning for this classification"
}}

## Decision Guidelines
- **hai_confirmed** (confidence >= 0.7): Clear CLABSI with no alternative source
- **not_hai** (confidence >= 0.7): Clear alternative source identified
- **pending_review** (confidence < 0.7): Ambiguous, needs IP review

Be conservative - when in doubt, recommend review rather than auto-classifying.
